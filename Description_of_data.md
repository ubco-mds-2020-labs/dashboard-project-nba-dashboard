# Description of the Data

Our dashboard will be visualizing the data contained in the `players_stats_by_season_full_details.csv` data set found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jacobbaruch/basketball-players-stats-per-season-49-leagues).  This data set contains stats for basketball players in multiple leagues. For our dashboard, we will be limiting the data to only include players in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Each row in the data set pertains to a single player in a single season or a single year of playoffs. Some of the statistics that will be visualized in our dashboard are `3PM` (3-pointers made), `3PA` (3-pointers attempted), `STL` (steals), `AST` (assists), `PTS` (points). Other statistics will be displayed which will require data wrangling to acquire (for example, average points per game of a player over an entire season). The data will also be manipulated to view overall trends in statistics throughout the NBA as a whole (for example the average percentage of shots that are three pointers in a season throughout the NBA). Complementary data and other variables may be added through data wrangling depending on the time available to complete the project.
