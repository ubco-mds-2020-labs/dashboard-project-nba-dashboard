# Contributing to NBA Analytics

Whether you are a novice or experienced software developer, all contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## Getting Started

If you are looking to contribute to the *nba_analytics* codebase, the best place to start is the [GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/nba_analytics/issues). This is also a great place for filing bug reports and making suggestions for ways in which we can improve the code and documentation.

## Filing Issues

If you notice a bug in the code or documentation, or have suggestions for how we can improve either, feel free to create an issue on the [GitHub "issues" tab](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/nba_analytics/issues) using [GitHub's "issue" form](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/nba_analytics/issues/new). The form contains some questions that will help us best address your issue.

## Contributing to the Codebase

The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/nba_analytics), so you will need to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the project and make changes to the codebase. Once you have obtained a copy of the code, you should create a development environment that is separate from your existing Python environment so that you can make and test changes without compromising your own work environment.

Once your changes are ready to be submitted, make sure to push your changes to GitHub before creating a pull request. We will review your changes, and you will most likely be asked to make additional changes before it is finally ready to merge. However, once it's ready, we will merge it, and you will have successfully contributed to the codebase!

The code of conduct for contributors can be found at [code of conduct.md](https://github.com/ubco-mds-2020-labs/nba_analytics/blob/main/Code%20of%20Conduct.md).
