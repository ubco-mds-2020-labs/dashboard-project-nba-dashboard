# Dashboard Ideas

### Ideas using the current dataset:

- A simple dashboard showing individual players stats and how they change over time.
    - Limit it to NBA players. 
    - Stick to interesting stats (don't use all of them)
    - You could group by playoffs or regular season to see how stats compare during those different playing scenarios. 

- A dashboard showing how trends in the NBA as a whole change over time.
    - We would need to group by season and find the averages of different stat categories and see how they change over time. 

- Group by different categories to see how stats change over time when you select a different category. For example:
    - Group by team to see how stats change over time for teams
    - Group by height to see difference in stats among players of different heights. 

### Ideas if we include other datasets:

- A dashboard comparing different teams:
    - Compare their team payroll to their number of wins per season. This would require a dataset of payroll and team wins. 

- A dashboard showing shot selection of different players
    - This would require a dataset with coordinates of shot locations and a way to map them onto a visualization. 
    - Here is an example of a dashboard that does this: [NBASavant](https://www.nbasavant.com/shot_search.php)
    - This [link](https://datavizardry.com/2020/01/28/nba-shot-charts-part-1/) Shows how to get shot chart data from the NBA API in python.

- Players performance comparisons before and after injuries:
    - I think this may be too complicated for this project. 

- Some sort of dashboard showing the amounts of calls that refs make based on the time of the came:
    - it may be interesting to see if referee influence is higher or lower at certain points of the game. 

- A dashboard comparing difference between home and away games:
    - see if refs make more calls in favor of the home team
    - see if players have better stats in their home arena.
