# Ideas for teamwork document

- Decide on division of work as a group
    - Reach out to other group members for help if we won't be able to complete our individual tasks on time. 

- Frequency of meeting:
    - Every other day at (CHOOSE A TIME)

- Meeting details:
    - Read over meeting discussion topics prior to the meeting and add to it if needed. 
    - Follow up on assignments/progress. 
    - I don't think there is a need for minutes or anything that formal. 

- Timelines:
    - Set a timeline for tasks and track our progress according to this timeline at each meeting and more as needed over Slack. 

- Communication:
    - Use Slack group for communication between meetings. 

- Availability:
    - Add any times when team members are not available. 
    - I try to avoid work on Sundays if possible (I do work on Sundays if I need to meet a deadline, but I try to keep Sundays for family/church stuff.)
