# Topics to discuss at the next meeting:

- Decide on a dashboard idea and a dataset

- Keep in mind the main goal of the project: Learn to build a dashboard:
    - We need to balance the desire to make something really interesting and cool with the reality of the limited time we have to work on this project.
    
    - We can always use this project to learn the basics of making a dashboard, and then spend time in the future making a really interesting dashboard that would require more work. 

- Discuss what is the best way to use Github and collaborate:
    - Will we use branches and work on the same files or different files?
    - How/If we will use pull requests. 

- Divide up the following assignments for the proposal:

    1. Motivation and Purpose
    2. Description of the Data
    3. Research Question and Usage Scenarios
    4. Description of App + Sketch
    5. Team work contract and collaborative document
    6. Code of conduct (Do we need to write out own?)
    7. Contribution Guidelines
